What we are trying to achieve

# Project Goals

* Develop Unreal Plugin
	[x] Set up as Plugin, with editor-only partitioning
	[x] Create architecture design proposal (mockups?)
	[x] Address storage of example/model data
* RapidLib wrapper development
	[x] Review use of JSON as an internal format
	[x] Direct C++ integration of lib? (no DLL)
* Blueprint development
	[x] Recording, training, and running of ML algorithms
	[x] Support variety of input sources and data types
	[x] Support re-use of systems and easy setup (macros?)
	[x] (Drag and drop of actors to source nodes)
* Documentation and Samples
	[x] Build sample scenes demonstrating each algorithm in use
	[ ] Develop and maintain documentation on the use-cases and workflows (wiki)
	[ ] Develop and maintain technical architecture documentation (comments & docs)
	[ ] Web-site update to support Unreal plugin
* Usability
	* Involvement in user studies
	* Garner feedback (issue tracker) to drive improvement (fixes/features)
	* Work on usability improvements to the UI and workflow
* Stability & Performance
	* Ensure solid and reliable operating of all systems - *ongoing*
	* Construct some automated test rigs (soak/thrash) to expose issues (leaks/crashes/instability)
	* Ensure performant operation, advise on best practices, steer technical design
	* Construct some automated performance tests (stats report) to monitor regressions
* Development
	[x] Use branches to develop features
	[ ] Track issues
	[x] Keep team informed of updates - *ongoing*
	[x] Planning and milestones - *ongoing*


# Stretch Goals
* VR layer
	* Build experimental VR sample scene/application
	* In-world interaction UI for recording/training/testing
	* Enable re-use of specific parts needed to support VR
	* Documentation for builders of VR experiences
* Performance II
	* Address stalls, with move/upgrading to multi-threading of algorithms
