# InteractML
*Bringing Machine Learning to Unreal Engine*

InteractML brings machine learning visual scripting to Unreal, empowering game creators to develop novel gameplay mechanics and control schemes without writing code. You can create ML models by joining Blueprint nodes together, feeding them from any game parameters, and then using the outputs to drive any in-game systems or effects you like.

**Machine Learning**

Interactive machine learning (IML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) research where users, generally non-experts, can quickly create and test ML models. These models can learn input/outputs from real-time data through human/computer examples (e.g. when the user moves his arms up-down the character swims upwards).

**Create New Interfaces**

Joysticks for videogames? Really? We can do more for our players. Using the power of Interactive Machine Learning, InteractML lets you control what interfaces you use as inputs and what the gestures look and feel like in your game. Let players tell you how they want to play. Set your game's interface free.

We provide a number of ready-made examples using different input devices, ranging from mouse/keyboard, arduinos to modern VR systems with motion tracking. You can also pipe values from your own custom devices if you wish to. Anything you can send to Unreal can be used in InteractML!

# Installation

The InteractML Plugin is available for free on the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/assets?count=20&keywords=machine%20learning). Add it to your project using the Epic Games Launcher.

# Usage

1. Configure the plugin
2. Set up your scene
3. Add the machine learning nodes
4. Add Training Set and Model assets for them to use
5. Provide input parameters to train and run against
6. Hook up the Record, Train, and Run inputs to your controllers
7. Run the scene to record examples and train the model
8. The Model node can now be used to do ML in your project!
